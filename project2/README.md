Advanced Machine Learning Project 2: Heart rhythm classification from raw ECG signals

# Work done

features_ata.csv contains 64 features extracted from ecg file. For detailes take a look at feature_extraction_ata.ipynb where the feature extraction is performed.  

# TODO

Perform preprocessing (outlier detection, label balancing, normalisation, etc.) and classification using features_ata.csv. For classification maybe first try using 1 vs all for class 3 and then further classify class 0,1,2.
